The SJ Ignore Script (AKA The Fuckoffhawkinator)
==============

A really badly hacked together but working Greasemonkey script to allow for ignoring users on PHPbb. In any given thread, the names of the users are converted into links which will ignore that user when clicked. Their posts are then blanked out with an option to display individual posts. To un-ignore a user, view one of their posts and click the 'Stop ignoring...?' link on the left-hand side. 

_Problems_
* Quotes from ignored users will still show up
* Threads started by ignored users will still be visible

_To use_
1. Install Greasemonkey from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
2. Install the ignore script from here: https://github.com/theghostofsaville/SJIgnoreScript/raw/master/SJIgnore.user.js
